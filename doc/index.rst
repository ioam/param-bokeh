**Generate bokeh widgets for parameterized objects**

ParamBokeh is an `open-source
<https://github.com/ioam/parambokeh/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_ Python
library that allows you to easily create GUIs from existing objects
(in Jupyter notebooks, Bokeh apps, and potentially more)

The `User Guide <user_guide>`_ shows the concepts involved with ParamBokeh
and should help you get started using it as quickly as possible.

Please feel free to report `issues
<https://github.com/ioam/parambokeh/issues>`_ or `contribute code

welcome to chat with the developers on `gitter
